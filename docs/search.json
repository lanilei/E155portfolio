    "text": "This week a iCE40 UP5K FPGA development board was assembled to house a UPduino v3.1 MCU. The board’s functionality was verified by programming a seven segment display to represent all digits of hex based on 4 switches on the dev board represented by inputs s[3:0]. In order to further test the functionality three LEDs on the dev board were programmed- 2 to turn on based on inputs s[3:0] and 1 to oscillate at 2.4 Hz. Both the seven segment display and all 3 leds worked as expected, both in sim and in situ, confirming the FPGA dev board’s functionality. This process took a total of 30 hours."

The LEDs were combined to be driven by LED.SV and the Seven segment display was controlled using combinational logic in its own module. These two modules were tied together using a top module that called upon them both."

    "section": "AI Results Summary",
    "text": "AI Results Summary\n The AI generated system verilog was interesting. I would not have thought to use local param integer command for the counter. The most useful part of the experience of prompting AI was the immediate generation of a full module. However, it did not include enough detail for me to understand the details of its implementation.\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Error message from synthesis attempt in lattice\n\n\nThe AI seemed to call upon a module that didn’t exist as it did not define SB_HFOSC as a module. This type of hallucination is why it can be more difficult to program with AI than without it.\n\n\n\nFigure 10. How AI suggested i resolved the error message\n\n\nNone of the suggested resolutions included establishing SB_HFOSC as a module. It instead put out a bunch of solutions that seemed to overcomplicate things.\nA better use of AI would be to have it explain error messages and help with recalling forgotten syntax. It is better to do the programming oneself.\nThank you for reading my write up! Stay tuned for another exciting lab drop next week!!!"

    "text": "I am really excited to learn more about microprocessors! I think especially building the FPGA then creating all the verilog and verifying it will bring a depth and confidence to my digital electronics knowledge that I haven’t reached before. I’m also hoping to improve my debugging skills as that has been a consisten bottleneck in my programming processes. My Goals are to develop an indepth understanding on the microproccessor and FPGA programming processes and to improve my efficiency at these skills. I also hope to make friends along the way! Long hours in the basement has a way of bringing people together :3"
