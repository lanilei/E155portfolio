The board’s functionality was verified by programming a seven segment display to represent all digits of hex based on 4 switches on the dev board represented by inputs s[3:0]. In order to further test the functionality three LEDs on the dev board were programmed- 2 to turn on based on inputs s[3:0] and 1 to oscillate at 2.4 Hz. Both the seven segment display and all 3 leds worked as expected, both in sim and in situ, confirming the FPGA dev board’s functionality. This process took a total of 30 hours."

The most useful part of the experience of prompting AI was the immediate generation of a full module. However, it did not include enough detail for me to understand the details of its implementation.\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Error message from synthesis attempt in lattice\n\n\nThe AI seemed to call upon a module that didn’t exist as it did not define SB_HFOSC as a module. This type of hallucination is why it can be more difficult to program with AI than without it.\n\n\n\nFigure 10. How AI suggested i resolved the error message\n\n\nNone of the suggested resolutions included establishing SB_HFOSC as a module. It instead put out a bunch of solutions that seemed to overcomplicate things.\nA better use of AI would be to have it explain error messages and help with recalling forgotten syntax. It is better to do the programming oneself.\nThank you for reading my write up! Stay tuned for another exciting lab drop next week!!!"

I think especially building the FPGA then creating all the verilog and verifying it will bring a depth and confidence to my digital electronics knowledge that I haven’t reached before. I’m also hoping to improve my debugging skills as that has been a consisten bottleneck in my programming processes. My Goals are to develop an indepth understanding on the microproccessor and FPGA programming processes and to improve my efficiency at these skills. I also hope to make friends along the way! Long hours in the basement has a way of bringing people together :3"

However, it did not include enough detail for me to understand the details of its implementation.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.

When uploaded to a new Radiant project it compiled immeadiately. This means that the output was of good quality since there were no bugs preventing it from synthisizing. It also was able to put the verilog together far more efficiently than the time it took me to write manually.\nSome new syntax that was familar but not used much in the past was that it declared variables as unsigned when in the past I had just declared variables. The formatting was really clean and the comments were clear something I will aim for in my next projects.\nChat GPT was then prompted to “Write SystemVerilog HDL to time multiplex a single seven segment decoder (that decodes from four bits to a common anode seven segment display) to decode two sets of input bits and drive two sets of seven output bits. Use the seven segment decoder and oscillator provided in the attached files.”\nThis also took a matter of seconds after uploading the files. It also synthesized on the first try in Radiant. This means the code was not significantly buggy and therefore High Quality.\nNext time an LLM is used in my workflow I might call upon refrence files of my own since that seemed to create a more reliablw result."
