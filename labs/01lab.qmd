For Lab 1 I met all specifications and functions. 


## Introduction 
This week a iCE40 UP5K FPGA development board was assembled to house a UPduino v3.1 MCU. The boardâ€™s functionality was verified by programming a seven segment display to represent all digits of hex based on 4 switches on the dev board represented by inputs s[3:0]. In order to further test the functionality three LEDs on the dev board were programmed- 2 to turn on based on inputs s[3:0] and 1 to oscillate at 2.4 Hz. Both the seven segment display and all 3 leds worked as expected, both in sim and in situ, confirming the FPGA dev board's functionality. This process took a total of 30 hours.
